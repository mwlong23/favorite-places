    <h2>Santa Barbara</h2>
    <img src="img/rincon.jpg" alt="Man surfing">
    <p>Santa Barbara (Spanish for "Saint Barbara") is the county seat of Santa
      Barbara County in the U.S. state of California. Situated on a south-facing
       section of coastline, the longest such section on the West Coast of the
       United States, the city lies between the steeply rising Santa Ynez
       Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Santa Barbara's climate is often
       described as Mediterranean, and the city has been promoted as the
       "American Riviera".[11] As of 2014, the city had an estimated population
       of 91,196,[12] up from 88,410 in 2010, making it the second most populous
       city in the county after Santa Maria[13] while the contiguous urban area,
       which includes the cities of Goleta and Carpinteria, along with the
       unincorporated regions of Isla Vista, Montecito, Mission Canyon,
       Hope Ranch, Summerland, and others, has an approximate population of
       220,000. The population of the entire county in 2010 was 423,895.[14]

      In addition to being a popular tourist and resort destination, the city
      economy includes a large service sector, education, technology, health
      care, finance, agriculture, manufacturing, and local government. In 2004,
      the service sector accounted for fully 35% of local employment.[15]
      Education in particular is well represented, with four institutions of
      higher learning on the south coast (the University of California, Santa
      Barbara, Santa Barbara City College, Westmont College, and Antioch
      University). The Santa Barbara Airport serves the city, as does Amtrak.
      U.S. Highway 101 connects the Santa Barbara area with Los Angeles to the
      southeast and San Francisco to the northwest. Behind the city, in and
      beyond the Santa Ynez Mountains, is the Los Padres National Forest, which
      contains several remote wilderness areas. Channel Islands National Park
      and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary are located approximately
      20 miles (32 km) offshore.</p>

      <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
      <img src="img/Amsterdam.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Amsterdam (/ˈæmstərdæm, ˌæmstərˈdæm/;[9][10] Dutch: [ɑmstərˈdɑm] (About
      this sound listen)) is the capital and most populous municipality of the
      Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the
      Constitution of the Netherlands,[11] although it is not the seat of the
      government, which is The Hague.[12] Amsterdam has a population of 851,373
      within the city proper, 1,351,587 in the urban area,[13] and 2,410,960 in
      the Amsterdam metropolitan area.[8] The city is located in the province of
      North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises
      much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations
      in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.[14]

       Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme,[15] indicative of the
      city's origin around a dam in the river Amstel. Originating as a small
      fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the
      most important ports in the world during the Dutch Golden Age
      (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade.
      During that time, the city was the leading centre for finance and
      diamonds.[16] In the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many
      new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century
      canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam
      are on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Since the annexation of
      municipality Sloten in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, the
      oldest historic part of the city lies in Sloten (9th century).

      As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top
     financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha world
     city by the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) study group. The city
     is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands.[17] Many large Dutch
     institutions have their headquarters there, and seven of the world's 500
     largest companies, including Philips and ING, are based in the city.
     [18] In 2012, Amsterdam was ranked the second best city to live in by
     the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)[19] and 12th globally on quality
     of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer.[20] The city
     was ranked 3rd in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow
     in their Innovation Cities Index 2009.[21] The Amsterdam seaport to
     this day remains the second in the country, and the fifth largest
     seaport in Europe.[22]

     Famous Amsterdam residents include the diarist Anne Frank, artists
     Rembrandt van Rijn and Vincent van Gogh, and philosopher Baruch Spinoza.

     The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in the world, is
     located in the city center. Amsterdam's main attractions, including its
     historic canals, the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk
     Museum, Hermitage Amsterdam, Anne Frank House, Amsterdam Museum, its
     red-light district, and its many cannabis coffee shops draw more than
     5 million international visitors annually.[23] It is also the world's
     most multicultural city with at least 177 nationalities represented.
